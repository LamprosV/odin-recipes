    <h2>What Is Flat Iron Steak?</h2>
    <p>
      Flat iron steak is cut from beef shoulder. To make a flat iron steak,
      butchers remove the connective tissue to separate the top shoulder blade
      into two cuts: One is the top blade, the other is the flat iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flat iron steak is nicely marbled and is less expensive than other steaks,
      which makes it a popular choice among home cooks. When it's cooked
      correctly, flat iron steak is wonderfully tender and juicy.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingridients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1</strong> flat iron steak</li>
      <li><strong>2 & 1/2</strong> tablespoon(s) olive oil</li>
      <li><strong>2</strong> cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li><strong>1</strong> teaspoon(s) chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li><strong>1/4</strong> teaspoon(s) chopped fresh rosemary</li>
      <li><strong>1/2</strong> teaspoon(s) chopped fresh chives</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1/4</strong> cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)
      </li>
      <li><strong>1/2</strong> teaspoon(s) salt</li>
      <li><strong>3/4</strong> teaspoon(s) ground black pepper</li>
      <li><strong>1/4</strong> teaspoon(s) dry mustard powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Execution Method:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic,
        parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and mustard powder
        together in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can
        and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear and cook the steak
        in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or
        to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted
        into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium
        rare.
      </li>
      <li>
        Discard the marinade. Allow the steaks to rest for about 5 minutes
        before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
